If you're opening this in Notepad:
It's easier to read with Word Wrap enabled.
Click Format > Word Wrap.

Before running the exe for the first time:
Open config.ini and toggle off any features you don't want. Some features are off by default.
Feel free to tweak any of the settings as desired.

Settings you might want to change:
SCREEN_WIDTH = 2560 (if your monitor is 2560x1440, or set some other value as per your monitor)
SCREEN_HEIGHT = 1440 (if your monitor is 2560x1440, or set some other value as per your monitor)

Notes:
We have an OverStim channel in this server: https://discord.gg/AVpcVhQQhu
You can submit bugs via that channel, or via the GitHub issues.
I am also very open to feature requests.
Check out the pinned message in the discord channel to see my future plans.

Known Issues:
- Tab can be abused to re-trigger detection multiple times on the same elimination/assist message.
- Poor detection of Mercy's heal beam at 2560x1440p.
- Probably doesn't work at aspect ratios other than 16:9.
- High latency to the game server causes Mercy's beam to reconnect to people slower when switching beam types. This can cause temporary gaps in vibration.
- Only works on Windows.
